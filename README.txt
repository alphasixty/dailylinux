## This must be run in python3 as some of the methods are not available otherwise
## If you want to quit the program at any time just hit 'q'
## The program will keep going through the command dictionary until they have all been exausted
## If you get one wrong it will go back into the dictionary
## The commands are separated by type, if you want to take out or add certain command modules just comment them in or out
## If you want to add any commands the way I did then just use the description from the man page


## There is nothing used to strip out whitespace from the input
